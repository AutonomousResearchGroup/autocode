# autocode
Code that basically writes itself.

To run
```
python start.py
```

Instructions:
- Type in the name of the file -- you can select one that exists, or a new file

- Give detailed instructions for what you want to do-- either improvements to an existing file, or instructions for a new file.

- Let it cook for a while, then give it a try once the task is done.

- You will see a lot of errors in the log as it descends upon a solution. Or not, sometimes it just nails it.
