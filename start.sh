python start.py --model 4 --filename quantum_circuit.py --goal "Write a program that generates a quantum circuit, using cirq. The circuit should generate a series of random 0s and 1s and output a matrix of dimensions 16 width by 4 height with either a 0 or 1 for each value. The function for this should be modular. Print all steps to the console. Write a test that asserts that the output is valid and print the results to the console. The output matrix should be 16x4 dimension one-dimensional array. The values should be 0s and 1s, but they shouldn't be all 0s or all 1s. Make sure there is a test to confirm that they are randomly generated by the quantum circuit. Since quantum circuits are slow, use a small circuit and repeat it multiple times to fill in the 16x4 matrix"
